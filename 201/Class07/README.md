# Class 07 Reading-Notes

### Questions

#### Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

#### HTML Table Basics

2. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

-  Because they are ugly and are unpresentable

3. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

- <td> = Table data
- <tr> = Table row
- <th> = Table header

#### Introducing Constuctors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

- An ***Constuctor*** is a way to create one object.

- One advantage is that, to create more than one object from a single object definition, and that's the subject of the next section.

2. How does the term <this> differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

- When used in a constructor you are refering to one specific object. 

- When used in an object literal its for more than one object.

#### Object prototype using constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience

- ***Protoypes*** are the template model of an object.
- ***Inheritance*** is any additions to the origin of the template model. (NOTE. Common interview question for developers.)
