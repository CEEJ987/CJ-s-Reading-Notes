1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

A CSS transition allows a developer to animate the transition between two states of an element, such as a change in position, size, color, or opacity. With a transition, the element can smoothly change from one state to another over a specified duration and with a specified timing function.

2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

A CSS animation, on the other hand, allows a developer to create more complex and continuous animations that can run indefinitely or for a specified duration. With an animation, the developer can define multiple keyframes to specify how an element changes over time, and can also control the timing, direction, and looping of the animation.
