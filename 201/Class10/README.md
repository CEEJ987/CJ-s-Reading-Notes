# Class 10 Reading Notes

## Questions 

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

A syntax error occurs when the code violates the rules of a programming language. These errors are caught by the compiler or interpreter during the compilation or execution of the code. 

A logic error, on the other hand, occurs when the code executes but produces unintended or incorrect results. These errors can be difficult to identify because the code executes without throwing any errors.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

During past lab assignments, I have encountered various types of errors. For example, I have encountered syntax errors such as missing semicolons or parentheses, which were easily corrected by adding the missing characters. I have also encountered logic errors such as incorrect variable assignments, which required me to trace the code and identify the root cause of the error.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Understanind the significance of attention to detail and the learning the logic behind my code will help problem solve any broken code or malfunctions i have.

## Questions

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

It is an essential tool for any software developer who wants to understand and troubleshoot their code.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

It is a powerful feature that allows developers to step through their code line-by-line and see exactly what is happening at each stage of execution.

3. What is the call stack?

The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the sequence of function calls in a program. Whenever a function is called, it is added to the top of the call stack. When the function returns, it is removed from the stack. Allowing the program to keep track of where it is in the code and resetting when needed.
