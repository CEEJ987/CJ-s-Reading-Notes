    <h1>Greetings I am CJ.</h1>
    <article>
       <p class="firstp"> Technology been advancing for years and I believe know its more 
        to come. What really kept my interest for Tech, outside of gaming,
        is the graphic art behind it all. I am dedicated to be successful 
        as an artist, a trainer and last but not least Software developer.
        I've been seeking new forms of art ideas and techniques. I've 
        noticed a major difference in my drive to learn computer tech.
        I want to increase my knowledge and change my career path to 
        set a better foundation for my future. I've learned so much 
        about progression and adaptationand overcoming challenges.
        It was hard for me but I have developed motivation skills to 
        help me through the struggle. I didn't have any experience at all with 
        coding. It was difficult for me to make the decision to join the this program. 
        Although, I am extremely glad I did.  </p>

<!---
    College wasn't a thing for me, so I joined the military the influence from my dad.
    I didn't mind it but that was a experience in my life i wish i would've waited for.
    Which drove me to tech. When i saw the opportunity to learn about software developing
    I was immediately intrigued. I just had one concern though, I didn't know anything.
    So thats why I want use this quiz to help people like me get a little more aware.
