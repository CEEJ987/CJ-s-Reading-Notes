## Reading Notes

### How the web works.

- Clients and servers are computers connected to the internet.
- **Clients** are typically the web users
- **Servers** are computers that store web pages.

### Good to know

- **Your internet connection**- Allows you to recieve web-data. (Ex.The street between a house and the shop.)
- **TCP/IP**- (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet protocol) communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet.
- **DNS**- (Domain Name system) is like an addressbook for websites. Web browsers look at the DNS to find website's IP address.
- **HTTP**- (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.
- **Component Files**- A website is made up of many different files (Ex. Parts of goods at the store) 
  1. **Code Files**- Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  2. **Aassets**- THis is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a  website (Ex. Images, video, word document,and pdf's)

  ## What happens exactly!!

 1.  The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on (you find the address of the shop).

2. The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client (you go to the shop and order your goods). This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.

3. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets (the shop gives you your goods, and you bring them back to your house).

4. The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you (the goods arrive at your door â€” new shiny stuff, awesome!).

## The Order in which components are parsed

When browsers send requests to servers for HTML files, those HTML files often contain <link> elements referencing external CSS stylesheets and <script> elements referencing external JavaScript scripts.
-  Browser prse HTML file first to allow the browser to recognize any <link> references external to CSS and any <script>

- Next, the browser parsing the HTML file send a request back to the server for CSS files <link> and JavaScript Files <Script>

- The browser creates in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript

- As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and executes the JavaScript, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to interact with it.

## HTML



### Questions to be answered

1. **What is an HTML attribute?** (Reference link)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes#attribute_list

Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.

2. **Describe the Anatomy of an HTML element.**
The anatomy on a HTML element consist of opening and closing tags with the content in the middle. 
3. **what is the difference between <article> and <section>?**
The <article> tag relate to blog entry type features that can be reusuable. The <section> is just a stand alone piece of text. 
4. **What elements does a "typical" website include?** <base>, <header>, <body>, <footer>, <meta>, <style>, & <title>

5. **How does metadata influence search engine optimaization?** 
Elements belonging to the metadata content category modify the presentation or the behavior of the rest of the document, set up links to other documents, or convey other out-of-band information.

6. **How is the <meta> used when specifying metadata?** <base>, <link>, <script>, <style>, & <title>
(Reference link)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Content_categories#metadata_content

7. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

Hypertext transfer Protocol
Sends communication between browsers and servers.
At your request or a call
The documents fetched recontructed for sharers.


8. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are parsed in the browser.

- The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any <link> element references to external CSS stylesheets and any <script>-element references to scripts.

- As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from <link> elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from <script> elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and JavaScript.

- The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript.

- As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and executes the JavaScript, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to interact with it.

9. How can you find images to add to a website?
You can use your browser to find an img. also you can use the <img> tag insert img documents

10. How do you create a <string> vs a <number> in JavaScrip?
<string> you surrond the unicode characters with single or double qoutes.
<number> you follow the data with decimal digits.

11. What is a <variable> and why are they important in JavaScript?
Variable are important because the they give JavaScript something to refer to for a proper response.
Variables are letters, numbers or words that symbolize a previous meaning.
