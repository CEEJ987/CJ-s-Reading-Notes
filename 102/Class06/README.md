## JavaScript web-page activation.

Today we are learning web-page activation with **JavaScript**.

**JavaScript** is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in0time compiled programming language with first-class functions.JavaScript is a protoype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles.

## JavaScript and Java

JavaScript & Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constucts which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

## ***JavaScript***
- Object-oriented. No distinction between tyoes of objects. Inheritance is through the protoype mechanism, and properties and methods can be added to any object dynamically.
- Variable data types are not declared (dynamic typing, loosely typed).
- Cannot automatically write to hard disk.
- Free from form language.
- Class based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety.

## ***Java***
- Class-based. Objects are divided into classes and instances with all inheritance through the class hierarchy. Classes and instances cannot have properties or methods added dynamically.
- Variable data types must be declared (static typing, strongly typed)
- Can automatically write to hard disk
